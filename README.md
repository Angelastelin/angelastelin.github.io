**angelastelin.github.io**

A website for Angela Stelin to showcase her art.

There are two versions of the site:

- English: index.html

- Portuguese: port.html

You can switch between them using the language button on the site.

**Updating the Gallery (English Version)**

All images used in the English gallery live inside the images/ folder.
Each artwork has two files:

- A thumbnail (small preview) → shown in the gallery grid

- A full-size image → opened when someone clicks on the artwork

Both must be placed in the correct folders.

1. Uploading a Thumbnail

Resize the image to 687px × 432px.

Upload it to:
images/thumbs/

Name it consistently with the other images already in that folder
(example: artwork_12.jpg).

2. Uploading the Full-Size Image

Upload the full-resolution version to:
images/fulls/

Use the exact same filename as the thumbnail.

This pairing is what allows the gallery to show the correct image when clicked.
